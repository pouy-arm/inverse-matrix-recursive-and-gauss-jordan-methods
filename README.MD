## inverse matrix recursive and gauss jordan methods

The whole idea of this code is to show how fast each method does the work. As you can see after running the code, gauss jordan method does it way faster than inverse method.

The matrix dimensions can be changed.

To run the code:
1. First, build a folder named `build` using `mkdir build`
2. Then, inside the `build` folder, run `cmake ..` in terminal
3. After that, run `make`
4. And at the end, run `./NAME-OF-THE-PROJECT`
